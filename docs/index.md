# SmartRobot FollowLine & IoT

The objective of this practice is to implement a follow line with WiFi communication using MQTT libraries.

The requirements were to get a lap time below 20 seconds and to send the corresponding messages.

For this practice we are using the [*Smart Robot Car Kit V4.0*](https://eu.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-smart-robot-car-kit-v-4-0?gclid=CjwKCAiAhJWsBhAaEiwAmrNyq_3ZPlD2M9mNfQeDcEHBXK67VlbbaKadVQvOGKSp-iyao9TEu_ZG5xoCE9wQAvD_BwE) from [**ELEGOO**](https://eu.elegoo.com/)
